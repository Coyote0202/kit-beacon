// The is_valid_merkle_branch() checks to ensure that it's not possible to fake a deposit in
// the process_deposit() function. The eth1data.deposit_root from the deposit contract has
// been agreed by the beacon chain and includes all pending deposits visible to the beacon
// chain. The deposit itself contains a Merkle proof that it is included in that root. The
// state.eth1_deposit_index counter ensures that deposits are processed in order. In short,
// the proposer provides leaf and branch, but neither index nor root.
